# QUANTATIVE APTITUDE QUESTIONS

print("PROBLEM 1")
# A train running at the speed of 60 km/hr crosses a pole in 9 sec. Find length of train
speed = 60
time = 9
speed = speed * (5/18)
length = speed * time
print("Length of train is:" ,length)
print("----------------------------")

print("PROBLEM 2")
# A person buys a pen from a wholesaler at Rs. 10 for 20 pens. 
# He sells those pens at Rs. 10 for 15 pens. Find his profit or loss percent.
cost_price = 10 / 20
selling_price =  10 / 15
profit = selling_price - cost_price
print("Profit is:" ,profit)
profit_percent = (profit / cost_price) * 100
print("Profit percentage is: ", profit_percent)
print("----------------------------")

print("PROBLEM 3")
# Find the SI on rupees 10000 deposited for 3 years at 5% per annum.
P = 10000
T = 3
R = 5
SI = (P*R*T) / 100
print("Simple Interest is:" , SI)
print("----------------------------")

print("PROBLEM 4")
# How long does a train 1000 m long moving at a speed of 90 km/hr would take to pass through a 500 m long bridge?
d = 1500
speed = 90
speed = speed * (5/18) 
time = d / speed
print("Time required is: ", time, "sec")
print("----------------------------")
